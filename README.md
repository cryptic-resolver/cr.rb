This command line tool `cr` is used to **record and explain cryptic commands, acronyms and so forth** in daily life.
Not only can it be used in computer filed via our default sheet [cryptic_computer], but also you can use this to manage your own knowledge base easily.

- Currently we have **90** keywords explained in our default sheet!! ðŸŽ‰

<br>

## Install

```bash
gem install cryptic-less
```

Tested well on `Ubuntu` and `Windows 11`.

<br>

## Why

Imaging one day you come across a strange word: **CUPS** while reading a book of Unix, you try hard to find what it means. Another day you find the **WAF** in the world of web, you again endeavor to figure it out and remeber this acronym.

Day after day, many inquisitive people gather around to finnally decide to record them in one place at hand.

<br>


The aim of this project is to:

1. make cryptic things clear
2. help maintain your own personal knwoledge base

rather than

1. record the use of a command, for this you can refer to [tldr], [cheat] and so on. 


<br>


# Usage

```bash
$ cr a_com_d
# -> It means A COMmanD 

$ cr -u 
# -> update all sheets

$ cr -u https://github.com/ccmywish/ruby_things.git
# -> Add your own knowledge base! 

$ cr -h
# -> show help
```


<br>

# Implementation

cr is written in pure **Ruby**. You can implement this tool in any other langauge you like(name your projects as `cr_python` for example), just remember to reuse our [cryptic_computer] or other sheets which are the core parts anyone can contribute to.

## Sheet layout

Every sheet should be a git repository. And each should contain these files(we call these dictionarys):

1. 0123456789.toml
2. a.toml
3. b.toml
3. ...
4. z.toml

## File format

In every file(or dictionary), your definition format looks like this in pure **toml**:
```toml
# a normal definition
# notice that we want to keep the key case unsenstive
# because the case sometimes contains  details to help we understand
[XDG]
desc = "Cross Desktop Group"

# If you want to explain more, use 'full'
[xxd]
desc = "hex file dump"
full = "Why call this 'xxd' rather than 'xd'?? Maybe a historical reason"

# if there are multiple meanings, you should add a subkey to differ
[XDM.Download]
desc = "eXtreme Download Manager"

[XDM.Display]
desc = "X Display Manager"
```

We have more features than above
```toml
[JPEG]
desc = "Joint Photographic Experts Group"
full = "Introduced in 1992. A commonly used method of lossy compression for digital images"

[JPG]
same = "JPEG" # Yes, we just need to redirect this. No duplicate!
see = ['MPG','PNG'] # Yes, this is a `see also`

["H.265"]
desc = "A video compression standard" # The 'dot' keyword supported using quoted strings

```

## Name collision

In one sheet, you should consider adding a subkey to differ each other like the example above.

*But what if a sheet has 'gdm' while another also has a 'GDM'?*

> That's nothing, because cr knows this.

*But what if a sheet has two 'gdm'?* 

> This will lead to toml's parser library fail. So you hace these solutions
> 1. Use a better lint for example: [VSCode's Even Better TOML](https://github.com/tamasfe/taplo)
> 2. Watch the fail message, you may notice 'override path xxx', the xxx is the collision, you may correct it back mannually.
